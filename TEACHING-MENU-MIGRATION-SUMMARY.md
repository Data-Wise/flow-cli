## Items Preserved

### Token & Secrets Quick Ref

**Location:** Help & Quick Reference (unchanged)

**Rationale:** This refcard is used by multiple dispatchers:

- `dot` dispatcher (secret management)
- `g` dispatcher (GitHub token)
- `teach` dispatcher (Scholar integration)
- General git operations

Keeping it in Help & Quick Reference makes it accessible to all users, not just teaching workflow users. A link is also provided from Teaching/Reference.

---

## New Content Created

### 1. Landing Page

**File:** `docs/teaching/index.md`
**Purpose:** Overview and quick navigation hub for teaching documentation

**Sections:**

- Quick Navigation (4 sections with links)
- What is the Teaching Workflow? (capabilities and philosophy)
- Common Workflows (code examples)
- Version History (v3.0 vs v2.x)
- Getting Help (built-in help, docs, support)
- Next Steps (beginner/intermediate/advanced paths)

**Size:** ~300 lines, comprehensive entry point

### 2. Consolidation Plan

**File:** `TEACHING-MENU-CONSOLIDATION-PLAN.md`
**Purpose:** Planning document with rationale and structure

## ADHD-Friendly Design Patterns

### Visual Hierarchy

````text
🎓 Teaching (top-level, emoji icon)
  ├── Overview (landing page)
  ├── Getting Started (3 items, beginner)
  ├── Core Workflows (3 items, essential)
  ├── Features (7 items, capabilities)
  ├── Reference (5 items, quick lookup)
  ├── Advanced (6 items, power users)
  └── Legacy (4 items, archived)
```diff

### Progressive Disclosure

1. **Level 1:** Overview + Getting Started (entry point)
2. **Level 2:** Core Workflows + Features (main usage)
3. **Level 3:** Reference (quick lookup)
4. **Level 4:** Advanced (deep dives)
5. **Level 5:** Legacy (historical)

### Chunking

- No section exceeds 7 items (Miller's Law: 7±2 chunks)
- Related items grouped together
- Clear section boundaries

### Consistent Patterns

- All tutorials numbered and titled
- All refcards prefixed with topic name
- All guides use descriptive names
- Legacy clearly marked
