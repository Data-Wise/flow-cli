## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. Calculate and interpret correlation coefficients
2. Fit simple linear regression models
3. Assess model fit and assumptions

## Correlation

Correlation measures the strength and direction of linear relationships.

### Pearson Correlation

$$r = \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$

```{r}
# Calculate correlation
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 5, 4, 5)
cor(x, y)
```

## Linear Regression

Regression models relationships using a line of best fit.

### Model

$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$$

```{r}
# Fit regression model
model <- lm(y ~ x)
summary(model)
plot(x, y)
abline(model, col = "red")
```

## Summary

Correlation and regression are fundamental tools for analyzing relationships between variables.
