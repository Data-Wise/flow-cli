## This file intentionally has missing prerequisites

The `advanced-modeling` concept requires `nonexistent-concept`, which doesn't exist in the course.

This should be detected by `teach validate --deep` as a missing prerequisite error.

## Expected Error

```
ERROR: Prerequisite 'nonexistent-concept' not found in concept registry
       Required by: advanced-modeling
       File: lectures/week-05-missing-prereq.qmd
```
