## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. Calculate basic probabilities
2. Apply different sampling methods
3. Understand the principles of statistical inference

## Probability Basics

Probability quantifies the likelihood of events occurring.

### Fundamental Rules

- **Range**: $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$
- **Complement**: $P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A)$
- **Addition**: $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \text{ and } B)$

```{r}
# Simulate coin flips
set.seed(123)
flips <- sample(c("H", "T"), 100, replace = TRUE)
table(flips) / 100  # Empirical probability
```

## Sampling Methods

How we collect data affects the validity of our conclusions.

### Common Methods

1. **Simple Random Sampling**: Every member has equal chance
2. **Stratified Sampling**: Sample from subgroups
3. **Cluster Sampling**: Sample groups, then all within groups

```{r}
# Simple random sample
population <- 1:1000
sample(population, size = 30)
```

## Statistical Inference

Making conclusions about populations based on sample data.

### Key Concepts

- **Point Estimation**: Single best guess
- **Confidence Intervals**: Range of plausible values
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Evaluating claims

```{r}
# Confidence interval for mean
data <- rnorm(100, mean = 50, sd = 10)
t.test(data)$conf.int
```

## Summary

This lecture connected probability theory with practical sampling and inference methods.
