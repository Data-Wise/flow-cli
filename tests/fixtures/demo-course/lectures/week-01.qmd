## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

1. Define and calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode)
2. Distinguish between different data types (categorical, numerical)
3. Understand basic distribution properties

## Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the features of a dataset.

### Measures of Central Tendency

- **Mean**: Average of all values
- **Median**: Middle value when sorted
- **Mode**: Most frequent value

```{r}
# Example: Calculate mean
data <- c(10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
mean(data)
```

## Data Types

Understanding data types is fundamental to choosing appropriate statistical methods.

### Categorical Data

- **Nominal**: Categories without order (e.g., colors, names)
- **Ordinal**: Categories with order (e.g., rankings)

### Numerical Data

- **Discrete**: Countable values (e.g., number of students)
- **Continuous**: Measurable values (e.g., height, weight)

## Distributions

Distributions describe how data values are spread across possible outcomes.

### Key Properties

- **Shape**: Symmetry, skewness
- **Center**: Mean, median
- **Spread**: Range, variance

```{r}
# Visualize a distribution
hist(rnorm(1000), main="Normal Distribution")
```

## Summary

This lecture introduced three fundamental concepts that form the foundation for statistical analysis.
