## 🚀 HIGH PRIORITY - Workflow Enforcement (NEW 2025-12-29)

### Smart Branch Workflow Guards

**Problem:** Nothing prevents pushing directly to main/dev, breaking the feature branch workflow.

**Solution:** Smart guards in g dispatcher + shared pre-push hook with aiterm.

**Branch Flow:**

```
feature/* ──► dev ──► main
hotfix/*  ────┴───────┘
bugfix/*  ────┘
release/* ────────────┘
```

**New g dispatcher commands:**

| Command            | Description                   |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `g feature <name>` | Start feature branch from dev |
| `g promote`        | Create PR: feature/\* → dev   |
| `g release`        | Create PR: dev → main         |
| `g push`           | Modified with workflow guard  |

**Smart Features:**

1. **Warn by default** - Educational, not frustrating
2. **Show exact fix** - "Use: g promote" instead of just "blocked"
3. **Override available** - `GIT_WORKFLOW_SKIP=1 git push`
4. **Worktree aware** - Detects if in worktree context
5. **Violation tracking** - Log to `~/.claude/workflow-violations.log`

**Example Output:**

```
$ g push  (on main branch)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⛔ Direct push to 'main' blocked
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Workflow: feature/* → dev → main

Commands:
  g promote    Create PR: feature → dev
  g release    Create PR: dev → main

Override: GIT_WORKFLOW_SKIP=1 git push
```

**Integration with aiterm:**

- flow-cli: Shell commands (instant, zero overhead)
- aiterm: Rich CLI (`ait workflows enforce/branch-status/violations`)
- Shared: pre-push hook (installed by either tool)

**See:** `/Users/dt/.claude/plans/refactored-growing-riddle.md` for full proposal

## 🎯 CURRENT FOCUS - Production Use Phase (2025-12-24)

### Real-World Usage & Feedback Collection - IN PROGRESS 🚧

**Status:** Just started - Week 2 features complete, entering production use
**Goal:** Validate all features with real daily usage before building more

**What to Do:**

1. **Use Daily (1-2 weeks minimum):**
   - [ ] Use `flow status` every day
   - [ ] Try `flow status -v` for productivity metrics
   - [ ] Use `flow dashboard` for real-time monitoring
   - [ ] Work in actual projects with flow-cli
   - [ ] Track sessions naturally

2. **Document Experience:**
   - [ ] Note any friction points (commands that feel awkward)
   - [ ] Track pain points (things that slow you down)
   - [ ] List features you _wish_ existed (but don't assume they're needed)
   - [ ] Identify bugs or unexpected behavior
   - [ ] Note performance issues

3. **Evaluate:**
   - [ ] After 2 weeks, review documented friction
   - [ ] Prioritize issues by frequency and impact
   - [ ] Only consider new features if they solve real problems
   - [ ] Decide if Week 3 features are actually needed

**Why This Matters:**

- **Prevents feature creep:** Only build what's genuinely needed
- **Validates assumptions:** Real usage reveals real needs
- **Improves quality:** Focus on polish over quantity
- **ADHD-friendly:** Reduces complexity, sharpens focus

**Success Criteria:**

- Used for 2+ weeks consistently
- Friction points documented
- Feature requests based on actual pain
- No critical bugs discovered
- System feels stable and reliable

2. ✅ **Flatten docs/archive/ subdirectories** - COMPLETED
   - 39 files moved to root with dated filenames (YYYY-MM-DD-category-name.md)

3. **Move .STATUS, TODO.md, IDEAS.md to project root**
   - Better visibility for control files
   - Easier access from command line
   - Already referenced from PROJECT-HUB.md

4. ✅ **Consolidate docs/development/ into docs/architecture/** - COMPLETED
   - Moved TESTING.md to docs/testing/ (better fit)
   - Removed empty docs/development/ directory

5. ✅ **Rename docs/hop/ to docs/guides/hop/** - COMPLETED
   - Clarifies purpose (it's a getting-started guide)
   - Better semantic grouping

### 🔧 Medium Effort (1-3hrs each)

6. ✅ **Implement docs/active/ folder for current-phase work** - COMPLETED
   - Merged planning/current + implementation → docs/active/
   - Clear separation of active vs. archive

7. ✅ **Split docs/user/ into docs/guides/ and docs/reference/** - COMPLETED
   - guides/ = tutorials and workflows
   - reference/ = command refs, alias cards

8. ✅ **Create docs/decisions/ (ADR-style)** - COMPLETED

### 🚀 Big Ideas (1+ days)

11. **Implement versioned documentation**
    - docs/v1/, docs/v2/ for major releases
    - Support multiple versions simultaneously
    - Better for users on older versions

12. **Create unified documentation index**
    - Smart search leveraging MkDocs search + tags
    - Cross-reference discovery
    - "Related docs" suggestions

13. **Build interactive documentation map**

## 🔮 FUTURE IDEAS (Only if Production Use Reveals Need)

### ⚠️ WARNING: Do NOT Build These Without Real User Data

The following ideas were brainstormed but should **only** be implemented if production use reveals they solve actual problems:

### Week 3+ Feature Ideas (PAUSED - Need Validation)

#### Advanced Workflows

- Template system for common workflows
- Workflow checklists
- Custom workflow definitions
- Workflow sharing/export

**Validate first:** Do users actually need workflow templates, or is the current system enough?

#### External Integrations

- Jira integration
- Linear integration
- GitHub Issues integration
- Asana/Trello connectors

**Validate first:** Are users managing tasks elsewhere that need integration?

#### Analytics Dashboard

- Trend analysis over weeks/months
- Productivity heatmaps
- Long-term metrics visualization
- Goal tracking

**Validate first:** Is the current status/dashboard sufficient, or do users need historical analysis?

#### Mobile Companion

- Mobile app for status viewing
- Push notifications for sessions
- Quick actions from phone
- Sync across devices

**Validate first:** Do users actually need mobile access, or is CLI enough?

#### AI-Powered Features

- Smart task suggestions
- Auto-categorization
- Predictive focus times
- Context-aware recommendations

**Validate first:** Would AI help or add complexity? Is simpler better?
