## ⚡ 10-Second Start

```bash
# 1. Install
brew install data-wise/tap/flow-cli   # macOS (recommended)
# or: antidote install data-wise/flow-cli
# or: zinit light data-wise/flow-cli

# 2. Work
work my-project    # Start session
win "Fixed bug"    # Log win → get dopamine
finish             # Done for now
```

**That's it.** Everything else is optional.

!!! info "Zero Dependencies"
flow-cli is a **standalone ZSH plugin** with no dependencies on Oh-My-Zsh, antidote, or any other framework. Choose any installation method that works for you - they all load the same independent plugin.

## 🎯 Why This Exists

| ADHD Challenge         | flow-cli Solution             |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| "Where was I?"         | `why` shows your context      |
| "What should I do?"    | `dash` shows priorities       |
| No visible progress    | `win` logs accomplishments    |
| Context switching pain | `hop` instant project switch  |
| Starting is hard       | `work` removes friction       |
| Multiple devices       | `flow sync` keeps wins synced |

---

## 🚀 Core Commands

### Start & Stop

```bash
work myproject     # Start working (creates session)
finish "done X"    # End session (optional commit)
hop other          # Quick switch (tmux)
```

### Stay Motivated

```bash
win "Fixed the bug"     # Log accomplishment → 🔧 fix
win "Deployed v2"       # Log accomplishment → 🚀 ship
yay                     # See your wins
flow goal set 3         # Daily target
```

### Stay Oriented

```bash
dash           # What's happening?
why            # Where was I?
pick           # Choose a project
```

---

## 🧠 ADHD-Friendly Features

### 🏆 Dopamine Hits

Every `win` gives you a category and emoji:

- 💻 code - "Implemented feature"
- 🔧 fix - "Fixed that bug"
- 🚀 ship - "Deployed to prod"
- 📝 docs - "Updated README"
- 🧪 test - "Added tests"

### 🔥 Streak Tracking

```
Day 1: work → 🌱 1 day
Day 3: work → 🔥 3 days - On a roll!
Day 7: work → 🔥🔥 Strong week!
```

### 📊 Dashboard

```bash
dash              # Quick overview
dash -i           # Interactive picker
dash --watch      # Live updates
```

### ☁️ Multi-Device Sync (v4.7.0)

Sync your wins and goals across devices via iCloud:

```bash
flow sync remote init    # Set up once
flow sync                # Auto-sync daily
```

Works offline, syncs when connected. Zero config after setup.

### ⚡ Performance Optimization (v5.3.0)

Sub-10ms project picker with intelligent caching:

```bash
pick              # < 10ms (cached)
flow cache status # Check cache age
flow cache refresh # Force rebuild
```

**40x faster** than v5.2.0 for large project sets (100+ repos). Transparent 5-minute cache with automatic refresh.

## 🔌 Smart Dispatchers

Context-aware commands that adapt to your project:

| Command           | What it does                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `cc`              | Launch Claude Code here        |
| `cc pick`         | Pick project → Claude          |
| `cc pick opus` ✨ | Pick → Opus (natural order!)   |
| `dot`             | Manage dotfiles & secrets      |
| `dot edit .zshrc` | Edit dotfile with preview      |
| `dot ignore add`  | Add ignore pattern (safety) ✨ |
| `dot size`        | Analyze repository size ✨     |
| `r test`          | Run R package tests            |
| `qu preview`      | Preview Quarto doc             |
| `g push`          | Git push with safety           |
| `flow sync`       | Sync data across devices       |

Each dispatcher has built-in help: `cc help`, `dot help`, `r help`, etc.

**✨ New in v4.8.0:** Unified grammar - both `cc opus pick` AND `cc pick opus` work identically!
**✨ New in v5.0.0:** Dotfile management with `dot` dispatcher
**✨ New in v5.5.0:** macOS Keychain secrets with Touch ID - instant access, no unlock needed!
**✨ New in v5.9.0:** Schema-based config validation with hash-based caching for teaching workflows!
**✨ New in v5.23.1:** Intelligent safety checks - git detection, preview, auto-suggestions for ignore patterns!
