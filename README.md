## 🎯 Why This Exists

| ADHD Challenge         | flow-cli Solution            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| "Where was I?"         | `why` shows your context     |
| "What should I do?"    | `dash` shows priorities      |
| No visible progress    | `win` logs accomplishments   |
| Context switching pain | `hop` instant project switch |
| Starting is hard       | `work` removes friction      |

---

## 🚀 Core Commands

### Start & Stop

```bash
work myproject     # Start working (creates session)
finish "done X"    # End session (optional commit)
hop other          # Quick switch (tmux)
```

### Stay Motivated

```bash
win "Fixed the bug"     # Log accomplishment → 🔧 fix
win "Deployed v2"       # Log accomplishment → 🚀 ship
yay                     # See your wins
flow goal set 3         # Daily target
```

### Stay Oriented

```bash
dash           # What's happening?
why            # Where was I?
pick           # Choose a project
```

## 🧠 ADHD-Friendly Features

### 🏆 Dopamine Hits

- 💻 code - "Implemented feature"
- 🔧 fix - "Fixed that bug"
- 🚀 ship - "Deployed to prod"

### 🔥 Streak Tracking

```

### 📊 Dashboard

```bash
dash              # Quick overview
dash -i           # Interactive picker
dash --watch      # Live updates
```

---

## 🔌 Smart Dispatchers

Context-aware commands that adapt to your project:

| Command      | What it does            |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `cc`         | Launch Claude Code here |
| `cc pick`    | Pick project → Claude   |
| `r test`     | Run R package tests     |
| `qu preview` | Preview Quarto doc      |
| `g push`     | Git push with safety    |

Each dispatcher has built-in help: `cc help`, `r help`, etc.
