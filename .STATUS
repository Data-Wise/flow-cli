# flow-cli - Pure ZSH Workflow Plugin
# ADHD-optimized workflow management for developers

## Project: flow-cli
## Type: zsh-plugin
## Status: active
## Phase: v5.16.0 - In Development
## Priority: 1
## Progress: 60

## Focus: Intelligent Content Analysis (teach analyze)

## ✅ Just Completed (2026-01-22):

### teach analyze - ALL PHASES COMPLETE + Optimized

**PR #289:** Merged to dev (Phases 0-5: concept extraction, caching, reports, AI, slides, polish)
**PR #290:** Merged to dev (post-merge optimization)

**Optimization (PR #290):**
- Added self-protecting load guards to 6 lib files (prevents double/triple-sourcing)
- Extracted display layer to `lib/analysis-display.zsh` (7 functions, 270 lines)
- Fixed slide cache path collisions (directory-mirroring structure)
- Removed redundant sources from `flow.plugin.zsh` and dispatcher

**Brainstorm:** Config→concept graph integration (Option D: Hybrid Enrichment for Phase 1)
**Spec:** `docs/specs/SPEC-teach-analyze-optimization-2026-01-22.md`

### Bug Fix: wt dispatcher passthrough

- `wt lock/unlock/repair` now correctly passes through to `git worktree`
- Added `lock|unlock|repair` to known commands list

---

## 🎯 Current Sprint:

### v5.16.0 - Bundling for Release

**On dev (ready for release):**
- teach analyze (Phases 0-5) — full concept graph + AI + slide optimization
- teach analyze optimization (load guards, display extraction, cache fix)
- Documentation debt (348 functions documented, 49.4% coverage)
- wt dispatcher passthrough fix

## 🗂️ Active Worktrees:

| Worktree | Branch | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Main repo | `dev` | Planning/coordination |

## 📝 Pending:

### SPEC-teach-prompt-command (Paused)
- ⏸️ Needs Scholar plugin coordination

### Config→Concept Graph Integration (Phase 1 Enhancement)
- Brainstorm complete: `docs/specs/BRAINSTORM-config-concept-graph-integration-2026-01-22.md`
- Approach: Option D (Hybrid Enrichment) — non-breaking config cross-referencing
- Validate week assignments against `teach-config.yml`
- Match file titles to config topics as fallback
