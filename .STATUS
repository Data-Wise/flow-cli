# flow-cli - Pure ZSH Workflow Plugin
# ADHD-optimized workflow management for developers

## Project: flow-cli
## Type: zsh-plugin
## Status: active
## Phase: v5.10.0 Released ✅
## Priority: 1
## Progress: 100

## Focus: Triple-track v5.11.0 Development

## 🚧 Work In Progress (2026-01-16):

### Track A: Nvim/LazyVim Documentation - v5.11.0

**Spec:** `docs/specs/SPEC-nvim-documentation-2026-01-16.md`
**Branch:** `feature/nvim-documentation`
**Worktree:** `~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/nvim-documentation`
**Effort:** 18-22 hours
**Status:** ⏳ Ready for implementation (worktree created)

**Goal:** Comprehensive nvim/LazyVim documentation for complete beginners

**Key Insight:** nvim is already the default editor (line 54 of `commands/work.zsh`) but completely undocumented, creating a major onboarding gap.

**Deliverables:**
- 4 progressive tutorials (15-18: Quick Start, Motions, LazyVim Basics, Showcase)
- 1 quick reference card (NVIM-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)
- Interactive shell command (flow nvim-tutorial with honor system checkpoints)
- 14 GIF demonstrations
- Documentation updates (work.md, installation.md, mkdocs.yml)

**Implementation Phases:**
- Phase 1: Tutorial 15 (Proof of Concept) - 3-4 hours
- Phase 2: Complete Tutorial Series - 4-6 hours
- Phase 3: Reference Card & Interactive Tutorial - 5-7 hours

**Branch:** `feature/teaching-git-integration`
**Worktree:** `~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/teaching-git-integration`
**Effort:** 11-16 hours (5 phases)
**Status:** ⏳ Ready for implementation (worktree created)

**Goal:** Seamless git integration for teaching workflow with smart automation and PR-based deployments

**Key Insight:** Teaching content creation has natural "generate → review → commit → deploy" rhythm. Current manual git operations break flow state.

**User Research (8 expert questions):**
- Primary pain: Disconnect between teach commands and git workflow
- All user types benefit (instructors, TAs, git novices)
- Desired workflow: Generate → Review → Commit → Deploy
- Deploy strategy: PR-based (never direct push to production)
- Teaching mode: Yes, with confirmations (not silent automation)

**Deliverables:**

**Sprint 1 - Quick Wins (5-6 hours):**
- Phase 1: Smart post-generation workflow (2-3h)
  - Interactive: Review → Commit → Push?
  - Auto-generated commit messages
  - 80% of git friction eliminated
- Phase 3: Git-aware teach status (1-2h)
  - Show uncommitted teaching files
  - Offer to commit/stash interactively
- Phase 5: Git integration in teach init (1h)
  - Auto-create draft/main branches
  - One command full structure

**Sprint 2 - Power Features (7-10 hours):**
- Phase 2: Branch-aware deployment (4-6h)
  - PR-based workflow (draft → main)
  - Conflict detection before deploy
- Phase 4: Teaching mode (3-4h)
  - Streamlined auto-commit workflow
  - Configurable per-project

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- NEW: `lib/git-helpers.zsh` (8 functions)
- NEW: `tests/test-teaching-git-integration.zsh`
- MODIFIED: `lib/dispatchers/teach-dispatcher.zsh`
- MODIFIED: `commands/teach-init.zsh`

**Branch:** `feature/teach-dates-automation`
**Worktree:** `~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/teach-dates-automation`
**Effort:** 12-17 hours (5 phases)
**Status:** ⏳ Ready for implementation (worktree created)

**Goal:** Automated date/deadline management for teaching materials with centralized config and smart sync

**Key Insight:** Instructors manually update dates across 10+ files when semester changes. One config file should be the source of truth for all dates.

**User Research (8 expert questions):**
- Pain points: Manual updates, inconsistencies across files, semester rollover
- Source of truth: teach-config.yml + external calendar support
- Date types: Week starts, assignment deadlines, exams, holidays

- File formats: Quarto YAML frontmatter + Markdown inline dates
- Conflict resolution: Ask user (never auto-overwrite)
- Relative dates: Support "week + offset" syntax (e.g., week: 3, offset: +2 days)
- Triggers: Manual command + semester rollover wizard

**Deliverables:**

**Phase 1: Extended Config Schema (2-3 hours)**
- Extend teach-config.yml with:
  - `semester_info.weeks[]` (week number, start_date, topic)
  - `semester_info.holidays[]` (name, date, type: break/exam/special)
  - `semester_info.deadlines{}` (assignment → week/offset or absolute date)
  - `semester_info.exams[]` (name, date, time, location)
- Update teach-config.schema.json
- Add validation rules

  - `_teach_dates_sync()` - Main sync command
  - `_teach_semester_new()` - Semester rollover wizard
  - `_date_format()` - Format dates for display

**Phase 3: teach dates sync Command (4-6 hours)**
- Interactive file-by-file sync
- Preview changes before applying
- Conflict resolution (ask user)
- Support for:
  - Quarto YAML frontmatter (date:, due_date:, exam_date:)
  - Markdown inline dates (Week 3: January 22, Due: Feb 5)
- Dry-run mode (`--dry-run`)
- Selective sync by file type (`--assignments`, `--lectures`, etc.)

**Phase 4: teach semester new Command (2-3 hours)**
- One-command semester rollover
- Wizard prompts:
  - New semester name
  - Start/end dates
  - Shift all dates by N weeks
  - Preserve relative spacing
- Validation before applying
- Backup old config

**Phase 5: Integration & Documentation (1-2 hours)**
- Integrate with `teach init` (offer to set dates)
- Update `teach status` to show upcoming deadlines
- Comprehensive docs:
  - Tutorial: Setting up semester dates
  - Guide: Date sync workflows
  - Reference: Date format support
- 30+ tests

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- NEW: `lib/date-parser.zsh` (8 functions)
- NEW: `tests/test-date-parser.zsh` (30+ tests)
- NEW: `docs/guides/TEACHING-DATES-GUIDE.md`
- MODIFIED: `lib/dispatchers/teach-dispatcher.zsh` (add dates subcommand)
- MODIFIED: `lib/templates/teaching/teach-config.schema.json` (extend schema)
- MODIFIED: `commands/teach-init.zsh` (optional date setup)

**Success Metrics:**
- Time to update all dates: 30 min → 2 min
- Date inconsistencies: 20% → 0%
- Semester rollover time: 2 hours → 5 minutes

**Command Naming (To Be Decided):**

### Worktree Detection + Cache Invalidation - v5.10.0

**PR:** #253 (merged to dev)
**Commit:** f6b521a5
**Brainstorm:** `BRAINSTORM-worktree-detection-fix-2026-01-15.md`

**Problem:** `pick wt` failed to detect flat-named worktrees (e.g., `scholar-github-actions`)

**Root Cause:** `_proj_list_worktrees()` only scanned level-2 directories, missing flat worktrees at level-1

**Solution:** Hybrid Scanner
- Check level-1 dirs for `.git` FILE (flat worktrees)
- Parse `gitdir:` to extract project name
- Fall back to level-2 scan (hierarchical)

**Completed Tasks:**

**Phase 1: Flat Worktree Detection**
- [x] Root cause analysis complete
- [x] Deep brainstorm with 8 requirements questions
- [x] Solution design (Hybrid Scanner selected)
- [x] Feature branch created
- [x] Implement core fix in `_proj_list_worktrees()`
- [x] Implement fix in `_proj_find_worktree()`
- [x] Add 24 comprehensive tests
- [x] Update documentation
- [x] PR merged to dev

**Phase 2: Cache Invalidation**
- [x] Add `_proj_cache_invalidate()` to `wt create`
- [x] Add `_proj_cache_invalidate()` to `wt remove`
- [x] Test immediate worktree visibility
- [x] Commit 104484ea pushed to dev

**Acceptance Criteria (All Met):**
- [x] `pick wt` shows flat worktrees (e.g., `scholar-test-flat`)
- [x] All hierarchical worktrees still detected
- [x] 24/24 tests passing
- [x] Performance < 100ms
- [x] New worktrees appear immediately (no cache delay)
- [x] Removed worktrees disappear immediately

**Modified Files:**
- `commands/pick.zsh` - Hybrid detection algorithm
