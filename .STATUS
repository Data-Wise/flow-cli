## Current: Teach Doctor v2 — Fast Default, renv-Aware (2026-02-07)

**Deep brainstorm (20 questions) + spec captured** for teach doctor redesign.

**Session activity:**
- review: analyzed teach doctor output, found 3 bugs (quarto arithmetic, R renv false negatives, section nesting)
- brainstorm: deep mode (20 interactive questions) exploring UX, speed, renv, CI, summary format
- spec: SPEC-teach-doctor-v2-2026-02-07.md (8 increments, full sections)
- worktree: created feature/teach-doctor-v2 at ~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/

**Spec highlights:**
- Two-mode: quick (default, <3s) + full (--full, comprehensive)
- Batch R check (single R invocation vs 27)
- renv detection (status, library path, sync)
- Spinner UX with elapsed time
- Severity-grouped summary with fix commands
- Status line health indicator on teach startup
