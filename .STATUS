# flow-cli - Pure ZSH Workflow Plugin
# ADHD-optimized workflow management for developers

## Project: flow-cli
## Type: zsh-plugin
## Status: active
## Phase: Teach Comprehensive Documentation (feature/teach-comprehensive)
## Priority: 1
## Progress: 10

## 🚧 In Progress: Comprehensive Teaching Documentation (2026-02-02)

**Branch:** `feature/teach-comprehensive`
**Worktree:** `~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/feature-teach-comprehensive`
**Spec:** `docs/specs/SPEC-teach-comprehensive-2026-02-02.md`
**Target:** v6.2.0

**Objective:** Fill documentation gaps across all 29 teach subcommands. Documentation-only effort (no code changes).

**Gap Summary:**
- 9 Scholar wrappers (lecture, exam, quiz, etc.) have ZERO documentation
- Core workflow commands (init, deploy, config) barely mentioned
- No unified reference card for teach dispatcher
- teach-config.yml schema never formally documented
- Missing per-feature REFCARDs (analyze, dates, doctor)

**Deliverables (8):**

| # | File | Type | Status |
|---|------|------|--------|
| D1 | REFCARD-TEACH-DISPATCHER.md | Reference card | Pending |
| D2 | SCHOLAR-WRAPPERS-GUIDE.md | Guide | Pending |
| D3 | TEACH-CONFIG-SCHEMA.md | Reference | Pending |
| D4 | TEACH-DEPLOY-GUIDE.md | Guide | Pending |
| D5 | REFCARD-ANALYSIS.md | Reference card | Pending |
| D6 | REFCARD-DATES.md | Reference card | Pending |
| D7 | REFCARD-DOCTOR.md | Reference card | Pending |
| D8 | mkdocs.yml + cross-references | Integration | Pending |

**4 Mermaid Diagrams:** Workflow overview, Scholar architecture, config chain, command taxonomy

**Quality Bar:** Publication-ready, STAT-101 examples, bidirectional cross-references

**Files Created (planning phase):**
- ORCHESTRATE-teach-comprehensive.md (implementation plan)
- BRAINSTORM-teach-comprehensive-2026-02-02.md (decisions + gap analysis)
- docs/specs/SPEC-teach-comprehensive-2026-02-02.md (17.2K comprehensive spec)

## ✅ Just Completed: Documentation Index Redesign (2026-02-01)

**Session Duration:** ~1 hour (brainstorm → redesign → deploy)
**Status:** ✅ Complete, merged to main, deployed
**Impact:** ADHD-friendly index with 60% size reduction and immediate install→win flow

**Accomplishments:**
1. **Index Page Redesign**

### Token Age Calculation Bug Fix (2026-01-28)

**Session Duration:** ~15 min
**Status:** ✅ Fixed and pushed (937b9976)
**Impact:** Resolved false "expiring in 0 days" warning in `work` command

**Root Cause:**
- `_dot_token_age_days()` searched for `note:` field in Keychain output
- macOS Keychain stores `-j` JSON metadata in `icmt` (comment) field, not `note`
- Function always returned 90 (default), causing `days_remaining = 0`

**Fix:**
- Changed `grep "note:"` to `grep '"icmt"'`
- Added proper sed pattern to extract JSON from `icmt` field
- Token status now correctly shows "ok" instead of false expiration warning

**Commits:**
- 937b9976 - fix(dot): correct Keychain metadata field for token age calculation

---

### Template Support Spec & Worktree (2026-01-28)

**Session Duration:** ~45 min

### Config Consolidation Review & Planning (2026-01-27 Session 4)

**Session Duration:** ~25 min
**Status:** ✅ Plan revised and finalized
**Impact:** Interactive planning for #298, shelved #278 and #275

**Plan Revisions:**
- ❌ Removed: Rename teach-config.yml (keeping original name)
- ❌ Removed: Teaching style integration (deferred)
- ✅ Focused: Extract lesson plans only

**Design Decisions (Interactive):**
1. **Data model:** Reference-only (pointer in teach-config.yml)
2. **Migration:** Explicit `teach migrate-config` command required
3. **File structure:** Single lesson-plans.yml (not per-week files)
4. **Scope:** Lesson plan extraction only (defer teaching_style)
5. **Backup:** Create .bak file before modifying
6. **Errors:** Clear messages with "Run: teach migrate-config" hint
7. **Coordination:** Update Scholar (#299) after flow-cli stable

**Implementation Tasks (~4 hours):**
1. `teach migrate-config` command (1.5h)
2. Update `_teach_load_lesson_plan()` (1h)
3. Error handling updates (30min)
4. Demo course fixture (30min)
5. Tests (1h)

**Spec:** `docs/specs/SPEC-lesson-plan-extraction-2026-01-27.md`

**Orchestration Plan (3 parallel agents):**
```
Agent 1: Migration Command     Agent 2: Loader Update
├─ commands/teach-migrate.zsh  ├─ teach-dispatcher.zsh
├─ Extract weeks via yq        ├─ _teach_load_lesson_plan()
├─ Create backup               ├─ _teach_has_embedded_weeks()
└─ Preview/dry-run             └─ Error handling

Agent 3: Fixtures + Tests (after 1 & 2)
├─ Demo course teach-config.yml
├─ test-lesson-plan-extraction.zsh
└─ 23 tests
```

**Shelved Issues:**
- #278 (teach plan create) - Shelved for future
- #275 (teach dashboard) - Shelved for future

# Backend configuration (3 modes)
FLOW_SECRET_BACKEND=keychain   # Keychain-only (default, fast)
FLOW_SECRET_BACKEND=bitwarden  # Bitwarden-only (cloud)
FLOW_SECRET_BACKEND=both       # Dual storage (legacy)

# Graceful Bitwarden handling
if _dot_secret_needs_bitwarden; then
  # Only check/require Bitwarden when backend needs it
fi
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero dependency on Bitwarden CLI (unless opted in)
- ✅ Faster token operations (no Bitwarden unlock)
- ✅ Backward compatible (existing dual-storage still works)
