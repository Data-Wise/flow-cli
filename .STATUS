## 🎯 Current Sprint:

### Intelligent Content Analysis (teach analyze) - Ready for Implementation

**Branch:** `feature/teach-analyze`
**Worktree:** `~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/teach-analyze`
**Status:** Ready for Phase 0 implementation

**Scope:** Phase 0 Ultra-MVP
- Concept extraction from frontmatter
- Prerequisite validation (week ordering)
- Violation detection and reporting
- Zero AI dependency (heuristic-only)

**Specs:**
- SPEC-intelligent-content-analysis-2026-01-20.md (1,280 lines)
- PLAN-teach-analyze-phase0.md (implementation guide)

**Implementation Roadmap:**
- Phase 0: Prerequisite validation ← NEXT
- Phase 1: Caching + batch analysis
- Phase 2: Integration (validate, deploy)
- Phase 3: AI enhancement
- Phase 4: Slide optimization
- Phase 5: Polish + docs

**What Phase 0 Delivers:**
```bash
$ teach analyze lectures/week-05.qmd
# Validates prerequisites, reports violations
# Example: Week 5 requires concept from Week 7 → WARNING
```

## 📝 Pending:

### SPEC-teach-prompt-command (Paused)
- ⏸️ Needs Scholar plugin coordination
- `teach prompt` command deferred until Scholar teaching integration is clearer
