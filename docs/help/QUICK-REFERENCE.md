**Most useful git aliases:**

```bash
gst     → git status
ga      → git add
gcmsg   → git commit -m
gp      → git push
gl      → git pull
glog    → git log --oneline --graph
```

### Tab Completion

All commands support tab completion:

```bash
work <Tab>        # List all projects
g <Tab>           # List all git subcommands
teach <Tab>       # List all teach subcommands
```

---

### Help System

Every dispatcher has help:

```bash
<dispatcher> help

# Examples:
g help
r help
teach help
mcp help
```
