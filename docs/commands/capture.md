!!! tip "Log Wins Immediately"
Don't wait until the end of the day. Log wins as they happen for maximum dopamine and accurate tracking.

!!! tip "Use Categories"
Categories help you see patterns in your work. Are you shipping a lot but not writing docs? The weekly summary reveals it.

!!! tip "Breadcrumbs for Interruptions"
When you get interrupted, drop a quick `crumb` so you can pick up where you left off.
