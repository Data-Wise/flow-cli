**Git structure created:**

```
stat-440/
├── .git/                          # Git repository
├── .gitignore                     # Teaching-specific patterns
├── .flow/
│   └── teach-config.yml          # Course config (with git settings)
├── exams/                        # (empty)
├── slides/                       # (empty)
└── scripts/
    ├── quick-deploy.sh
    └── semester-archive.sh
```

**Current branches:**

```bash
git branch -a
# * draft
#   main
```

### Step 2: Explore Git Configuration

```bash
# View config
teach config
```

**Git settings (`.flow/teach-config.yml`):**

```yaml
git:
  draft_branch: "draft"          # Development branch (default)
  production_branch: "main"      # Deployment branch (default)
  auto_pr: true                  # Auto-create PRs on deploy
  require_clean: true            # Block deploy if uncommitted changes

workflow:
  teaching_mode: false           # Manual workflow (default)
  auto_commit: false             # No auto-commit (default)
  auto_push: false               # Never auto-push (safety)
```

**Exercise:** Try changing `draft_branch` to `dev` and see what happens.

```

**No menu, instant commit!**

### Step 3: Rapid Content Creation

```bash
# Create multiple items rapidly
teach quiz "Chapter 2"
teach slides "Week 3"
teach lecture "Hypothesis Testing"
teach assignment "Homework 2"

# All auto-committed!
git log --oneline -5
```

**Output:**

```
f1a2b3c teach: add assignment for Homework 2

## Part 6: Advanced Workflows

### Workflow 1: Weekly Content Creation

**Monday morning routine:**

```bash
# Start session
work stat-440

# Check current week
teach week
# Week 8 of 15

# Create week's content (teaching mode enabled)
teach slides "Week 8 - ANOVA"
teach quiz "Week 7 Review"
teach assignment "Homework 8"

# Review changes
git log --oneline -3

# Deploy
git push origin draft
teach deploy
```

### Workflow 2: Exam Season

**Create and review exams:**

```bash
# Disable teaching mode temporarily
teach config
# → Set teaching_mode: false

# Create exam with review
teach exam "Final Exam"
# Choice: 1 (review in editor)

# Make edits...

# Commit after review
# Choice: y (commit)

# Create answer key
teach exam "Final Exam - Answer Key"
# Choice: 2 (commit now)
```

### Workflow 3: Collaborative Teaching

**Working with TAs:**

```bash
# Create feature branch for TA
git checkout -b ta-assignments draft

# TA creates assignments
teach assignment "Problem Set 1"
teach assignment "Problem Set 2"

# Push TA branch
git push origin ta-assignments

# Create PR for review
gh pr create --base draft --head ta-assignments \
  --title "TA Assignments - Week 3-4"

# After review, merge to draft
gh pr merge <PR-number>

# Then deploy to production
teach deploy
```

---

## Part 7: Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Not a git repository"

**Symptom:** Git commands fail

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check if git initialized
git status
# fatal: not a git repository

# Re-run teach init with --no-git flag
teach init --no-git "STAT 440"

# Then initialize git manually
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### Problem: Deploy fails with uncommitted changes

**Symptom:**

```
❌ Deployment blocked: uncommitted changes detected
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Check what's uncommitted
teach status

# Either commit them
teach status
# Choice: 1 (commit all)

# Or stash them temporarily
git stash

# Then deploy
teach deploy
```

### Problem: Teaching mode not auto-committing

**Symptom:** Still seeing 3-option menu

**Solution:**

```bash
# Verify config
teach config

# Make sure BOTH are true:
workflow:
  teaching_mode: true
  auto_commit: true     # This must be true!
```

### Problem: PR creation fails

**Symptom:**

```
Error: gh: command not found
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Try again
teach deploy
```

---

## Part 8: Best Practices

### 1. Branch Strategy

```bash
# Always work on draft branch
git checkout draft

# Keep main clean (production only)
# Only merge to main via PR
```

### 2. Commit Hygiene

```bash
# Use teaching mode for rapid creation
# But review periodically:
git log --oneline -10

# Squash related commits if needed (before PR)
git rebase -i HEAD~5
```

### 3. Deployment Timing

```bash
# Deploy weekly (not daily)
# → Reduces PR noise
# → Easier to review

# Or deploy after major milestones:
# → After creating full exam
# → After completing week's content
```

### 4. Backup Strategy

```bash
# Push draft branch frequently
git push origin draft

# Even if not deploying yet
# → Protects against data loss
# → Enables collaboration
```

## Summary

You've learned the complete 5-phase git integration:

✅ **Phase 1:** Smart post-generation (3-option menu)
✅ **Phase 2:** Git deployment (PR automation)
✅ **Phase 3:** Git-aware status (uncommitted tracking)
✅ **Phase 4:** Teaching mode (auto-commit)
✅ **Phase 5:** Git initialization (repository setup)

**Key Commands:**

```bash
teach init "Course Name"    # Initialize with git
teach exam "Topic"          # Create content (3-option menu)
