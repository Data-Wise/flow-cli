1. Dashboard display (16 detailed patterns)
2. Work session start (7 patterns)
3. Idea capture (3 patterns)
4. Win logging (4 patterns)
5. Active session in dashboard (7 patterns)
6. ADHD helper `js` (6 patterns)
7. Session finish (3 patterns)

**Best For:**

- First-time installation validation
- After major changes
- Teaching new users

### 4. ZSH Configuration Tests

**Location:** `zsh/tests/run-all-tests.zsh`

**Purpose:** Validate ZSH plugin structure

**What It Tests:**

- Duplicate detection
- Dispatcher functions
- Startup performance

**Options:**

```bash
# Full suite (includes performance test)
zsh/tests/run-all-tests.zsh

# Quick (skip performance)
zsh/tests/run-all-tests.zsh --quick
```diff

**Best For:**

- After refactoring
- Checking for duplicates
- Performance regression

## Common Test Scenarios

### After Fresh Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/data-wise/flow-cli.git
cd flow-cli
./tests/interactive-dog-feeding.zsh
```bash

### Quick CI Check

```bash
./tests/automated-test.zsh && echo "CI: PASS"
```bash

### After Code Changes

```bash
# Full validation
./tests/automated-test.zsh
zsh/tests/run-all-tests.zsh --quick
./tests/interactive-dog-feeding.zsh
```zsh

## Troubleshooting

### Dog Test Shows Wrong Expected Output

**Fixed in v3.0.0!** Parameter parsing bug resolved.

### Command Not Found Errors

Make sure plugin is loaded:

```bash
source flow.plugin.zsh
```

### Tests Fail But Commands Work

Check for external command dependencies (grep, head, etc.)
