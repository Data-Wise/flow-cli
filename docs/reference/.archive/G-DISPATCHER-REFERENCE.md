# G Dispatcher Reference

> **Smart Git command shortcuts with feature branch workflow and protected branch guards**

**Location:** `lib/dispatchers/g-dispatcher.zsh`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
g                     # Quick status (short)
g add .               # Stage all changes
g commit "message"    # Commit with message
g push                # Push to remote
```text

---

## Usage

```bash
g [command] [args]
```diff

### Key Insight

- `g` provides shortcuts for the most common git operations
- Feature workflow enforces `feature/* → dev → main` pattern
- Workflow guard blocks direct push to protected branches
- Unknown commands pass through to git

---

## Feature Workflow

The feature workflow enforces a clean branching pattern:

```text
feature/* ──► dev ──► main
hotfix/*  ────┴───────┘
bugfix/*  ────┘
```bash

### Feature Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `g feature start <name>` | Create `feature/<name>` from dev |
| `g feature sync` | Rebase current feature onto dev |
| `g feature list` | List all feature/hotfix/bugfix branches |
| `g feature finish` | Push and create PR to dev |
| `g feature status` | Show merged vs active branches |
| `g feature prune` | Delete merged feature branches |

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. Start new feature
g feature start auth
# → Creates feature/auth from dev

# 2. Work on feature
# ... make changes ...
g aa && g commit "feat: add auth"

# 3. Keep in sync with dev
g feature sync
# → Rebases feature/auth onto dev

# 4. Complete feature
g feature finish
# → Pushes and creates PR to dev

# 5. After PR merged, cleanup
g feature prune
# → Deletes merged branches
```bash

### Promotion Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `g promote` | Create PR: `feature/* → dev` |
| `g release` | Create PR: `dev → main` |

```bash
# On feature/auth branch
g promote    # Creates PR to dev

# On dev branch
g release    # Creates PR to main
```text

---

## Feature Prune

Clean up merged feature branches:

```bash
g feature prune              # Delete merged (with confirmation)
g feature prune --force      # Skip confirmation
g feature prune --all        # Also delete remote branches
g feature prune --dry-run    # Preview only
g feature prune --older-than 30d  # Only branches >30 days old
```diff

### Options

| Option | Short | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `--force` | `-f` | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `--all` | `-a` | Also prune remote branches |
| `--dry-run` | `-n` | Show what would be deleted |
| `--older-than <d>` | - | Only prune older branches |

### Duration Format

- `30d` → 30 days
- `1w` → 1 week (7 days)
- `2m` → 2 months (60 days)

### Safety

- Only deletes merged branches
- Never deletes: `main`, `master`, `dev`, `develop`
- Never deletes current branch
- Only targets: `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`, `hotfix/*`

---

## Feature Status

Show which branches are merged and which are active:

```bash
g feature status
```text

**Sample output:**

```text
📊 Feature Branch Status
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🧹 Stale branches (merged to dev):
  • feature/old-auth                    (3 weeks ago)
  • bugfix/typo-fix                     (5 days ago)

⚠️  Active branches (not merged to dev):
  • feature/new-dashboard               4 commits ahead (2 days ago)
  • feature/api-refactor                12 commits ahead (1 hour ago)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Summary: 2 stale, 2 active
💡 Tip: Run g feature prune to clean up merged branches

## Passthrough

Unknown commands pass directly to git:

```bash
g remote -v        # → git remote -v
g cherry-pick abc  # → git cherry-pick abc
g reflog           # → git reflog
g tag v1.0.0       # → git tag v1.0.0
```bash

---

## Examples

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Start of day
g fetch --all
g main && g pull

# Start feature
g feature start new-dashboard
# ... work ...
g aa && g commit "feat: add dashboard"
g push

# Keep updated
g feature sync

# Complete
g feature finish
```text

### Quick Fix

```bash
g                       # Check status
g aa                    # Stage all
g commit "fix: typo"    # Commit
g push                  # Push
```text

### Undo Mistakes

```bash
g undo                  # Undo last commit
g unstage file.ts       # Unstage file
g discard file.ts       # Discard changes
```text

### Cleanup

```bash
g feature status        # See what needs cleaning
g feature prune -n      # Preview cleanup
g feature prune         # Do cleanup
```bash

---

## Integration

### With WT Dispatcher

Use worktrees for parallel feature development:

```bash
wt create feature/auth   # Create worktree
cd ~/.git-worktrees/project/feature-auth
g feature sync           # Keep in sync
```text

### With CC Dispatcher

Launch Claude in a feature branch:

```bash
g feature start auth
cc                       # Launch Claude in feature
```bash

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Direct push to 'main' blocked"

This is the workflow guard. Use the proper workflow:

```bash
g feature start <name>   # Start feature
g promote                # Create PR to dev
g release                # Create PR to main (from dev)

# Or override (not recommended):
GIT_WORKFLOW_SKIP=1 git push
```text

### "Not on a feature branch"

Some commands require being on a feature branch:

```bash
g feature start myfeature   # Create one first
g feature sync              # Then sync
```bash

### "Uncommitted changes"

Stash or commit before switching:

```bash
g st              # Stash changes
# or
g aa && g commit "WIP"
```
