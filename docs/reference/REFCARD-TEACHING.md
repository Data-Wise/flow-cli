| `{slug}` | `work <course>` | `.flow/teach-config.yml` |
| `{slug}d` | `./scripts/quick-deploy.sh` | `.flow/teach-config.yml` |

**Example:**
```yaml
# .flow/teach-config.yml
shortcuts:
  s545: "work stat-545"
  s545d: "./scripts/quick-deploy.sh"
```

**Usage:**
```bash
work stat-545   # Loads shortcuts
s545d           # Deploy (shortcut active!)
```

## 🌿 Branch Workflow

```
draft          →  Edit, commit, test
   ↓
production     →  Students see (deployed via GitHub Pages)
   ↓
Live Website   →  Auto-deployed by GitHub Actions
```

**Rule:** Always edit on `draft` branch!

**Safety:** `work` command warns if on `production`

---

## 🔄 Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Start session (branch check happens automatically)
work stat-545

# 2. Edit files
# Make changes in editor...

# 3. Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Fix typo"

# 4. Deploy (using shortcut)
s545d

# Total time: < 2 min
```

---

## ⚠️ Branch Safety

### On Production Branch (Warning)

```bash
$ work stat-545

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  WARNING: You are on PRODUCTION branch
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Branch: production
  Students see this branch!

  Recommended: Switch to draft branch for edits
  Draft branch: draft

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Continue on production anyway? [y/N]
```

**Best Practice:** Say `n` to auto-switch to `draft`

---

## 🎯 Common Tasks

### Fix Typo on Website

```bash
work stat-545      # Auto-checks branch
# Edit file
git add file.qmd && git commit -m "Fix typo"
s545d              # Deploy
```

**Time:** < 2 minutes

---

# Duration: 90
# Points: 100
# Filename: midterm1

# Edit exam
$EDITOR exams/midterm1.md

# Convert to Canvas QTI
./scripts/exam-to-qti.sh exams/midterm1.md

```

## 🛠️ Scripts Reference

### quick-deploy.sh

**Safety Checks:**
- ✅ Validates on `draft` branch
- ✅ Checks for uncommitted changes
- ✅ Handles merge conflicts
- ✅ Returns to `draft` after deploy

**Output:**
```bash
✅ Deployed to production in 47s
🌐 Site: https://example.com/course
⏳ GitHub Actions deploying (usually < 2 min)
```

**Error:**
```bash
❌ Must be on draft branch
Current branch: production
Run: git checkout draft
```

---

### semester-archive.sh

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/semester-archive.sh

Semester: spring 2026
Tag: spring-2026-final

Create archive tag? [Y/n] y

✅ Archived: spring-2026-final
```

**Next Steps (Displayed):**
1. Update `.flow/teach-config.yml` for next semester
2. Update `course.year` or `course.semester`
3. Commit config changes to `draft` branch

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "yq is required" | `brew install yq` |
| "Must be on draft branch" | `git checkout draft` |
| Merge conflict during deploy | Merge production into draft first, resolve conflicts |
| Shortcuts not loading | Run `work <course>` to load them |
| Production warning every time | You're on production branch → `git checkout draft` |
| GitHub Pages not deploying | Check Actions tab, verify Pages enabled |

---

## 🌐 GitHub Setup

### Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to repo Settings → Pages
2. **Source:** `production` branch
3. **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Save

- Edit directly on `production` branch
- Push to `production` manually
- Skip branch safety warnings
- Deploy with uncommitted changes
- Forget to update config for new semester
