## Overview

flow-cli uses **dispatchers** - single-letter or short commands that group related functionality. Each dispatcher follows a consistent pattern:

```bash
<dispatcher> <subcommand> [options] [args]
```

**Example:**
```bash
g status              # Git status
r test                # Run R tests
teach init            # Initialize course
```

```bash
g add .              # Add all changes
g add file.txt       # Add specific file
```

**Commit:**
```bash
g commit "feat: add user authentication"
g cm "fix: resolve login bug"
```

**Push/Pull:**
```bash
g push               # Push to remote
g pull               # Pull from remote
```

**View history:**

g log --oneline      # Compact log
g log --graph        # Visual graph
```

**Show changes:**
```bash
g diff               # Unstaged changes
g diff --staged      # Staged changes
```

**Expected Workflow (Beginner):**
```bash
# 1. Check what changed
g status

# 2. Stage changes
g add .

# 3. Commit
g commit "feat: add feature X"

# 4. Push
g push
```

---

### Intermediate

#### Feature Branch Workflow

**Create feature branch:**
```bash
g feature start my-feature
```

This:
- Creates `feature/my-feature` from `dev` (or main)
- Switches to new branch
- Ready to work

**Push feature:**
```bash
g feature push
```

**Create PR:**
```bash
g feature pr
# Uses gh cli to create PR to dev branch
```

**Finish feature (after merge):**
```bash
g feature finish
```

This:
- Switches back to dev
- Pulls latest changes
- Deletes feature branch locally

**Complete Feature Workflow:**
```bash
# Day 1: Start
g feature start user-profiles
# ... work on feature ...
g add .
g commit "feat: add user profile page"
g feature push

# Day 2: Create PR
g feature pr

# Day 5: PR merged
g feature finish
```

---

#### Branch Management

**List branches:**
```bash
g branch              # Local branches
g branch -r           # Remote branches
g branch -a           # All branches
```

**Create branch:**
```bash
g checkout -b new-branch
g co -b new-branch    # Short form
```

**Switch branches:**
```bash
g checkout branch-name
g co branch-name
```

**Delete branch:**
```bash
g branch -d branch-name        # Safe delete (merged only)
g branch -D branch-name        # Force delete
```

**Cleanup merged branches:**
```bash
g feature prune
# Deletes all local branches that are merged into dev
```

---

#### Stash Commands

**Save work in progress:**
```bash
g stash
g stash save "WIP: refactoring auth"
```

**List stashes:**
```bash
g stash list
```

**Apply stash:**
```bash
g stash pop            # Apply and remove
g stash apply          # Apply but keep
```

**Clear all stashes:**
```bash
g stash clear
```

---

### Advanced

#### Rebase & History Rewriting

**Rebase onto branch:**
```bash
g rebase dev
g rebase origin/dev
```

**Interactive rebase:**
```bash
g rebase -i HEAD~3
# Allows: pick, reword, edit, squash, fixup, drop
```

**Squash last 3 commits:**
```bash
g rebase -i HEAD~3
# Change 'pick' to 'squash' for commits to merge
```

---

#### Cherry-pick

**Pick specific commit:**
```bash
g cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

**Pick range:**
```bash
g cherry-pick commit1..commit2
```

---

#### Reset & Restore

**Undo last commit (keep changes):**
```bash
g reset HEAD~1
```

**Undo last commit (discard changes):**
```bash
g reset --hard HEAD~1
```

**Restore file from specific commit:**
```bash
g restore --source=<commit> file.txt
```

**Restore staged file:**
```bash
g restore --staged file.txt
```

---

#### Sync Workflow

**Update branch with latest:**
```bash
g sync
```

This:
- Fetches from origin
- Rebases current branch onto origin/dev
- Pushes if needed

**Force push (DANGEROUS):**
```bash
g push --force-with-lease    # Safer force push
```

- No need to stash or commit incomplete work
- Each worktree has its own working directory

#### Essential Commands

**Create worktree:**
```bash
wt create feature/new-feature
wt create feature/bug-fix dev
```

Output:
```
✅ Created worktree at ~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/feature-new-feature
Switched to branch 'feature/new-feature'

---

### Intermediate

#### Worktree Workflow Pattern

**Scenario:** Working on Feature A, urgent Feature B needed

**Steps:**

1. **Feature A in progress (main repo):**
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/dev-tools/flow-cli
   # Working on feature A, uncommitted changes
   ```

2. **Create Feature B worktree:**
   ```bash
   wt create feature/urgent-fix dev
   cd ~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/feature-urgent-fix
   ```

3. **Work on Feature B:**
   ```bash
   # ... implement urgent fix ...
   g commit "fix: urgent bug"
   g push
   gh pr create
   ```

4. **Return to Feature A:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/dev-tools/flow-cli
   # All your Feature A changes are still here!
   ```

5. **Cleanup after merge:**
   ```bash
   wt prune
   ```

---

#### Show Worktree Status

**Check status of all worktrees:**
```bash
wt status
```

Output:
```
main      /Users/dt/projects/dev-tools/flow-cli
  Branch: main
  Status: clean

feature-x ~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/feature-x
  Branch: feature/user-profiles
  Status: 2 files modified, 1 file added

hotfix-y  ~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/hotfix-y
  Branch: hotfix/login-bug
  Status: clean, ready to push
```

---

### Advanced

#### Worktree Best Practices

**1. Keep main repo on stable branch:**
```bash
# Main repo should stay on main or dev
cd ~/projects/dev-tools/flow-cli
git checkout main
# Never work directly in main repo
```

**2. Create worktrees from main repo:**
```bash
# Always create worktrees from main repo directory
cd ~/projects/dev-tools/flow-cli  # Main repo
wt create feature/new-feature dev
```

**3. Cleanup regularly:**
```bash
# Weekly cleanup
wt prune
```

**4. Name worktrees clearly:**
```bash
# Good names
wt create feature/user-authentication
wt create hotfix/critical-security-bug
wt create test/performance-optimization

# Bad names
wt create fix
wt create temp
```

---

#### Integration with work Command

**Start work in worktree:**
```bash
cd ~/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/feature-new-feature
work new-feature
# ... develop feature ...
finish "Add feature X"
```

---

#### Worktree Locations

**Default location:** `~/.git-worktrees/<repo>/<branch>/`

**Custom location:**
```bash
# Not recommended, but possible:
git worktree add /path/to/custom/location -b branch-name
```

**Why default is better:**
- Organized (all worktrees in one place)
- Easy to find
- Consistent structure
- Works with flow-cli's project detection

#### Secret Management (macOS Keychain)

**Get secret:**
```bash
sec GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Touch ID prompt → Shows token value.

**Store secret:**
```bash
sec add GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Workflow:
1. Prompts: `Enter value for GITHUB_TOKEN:`
2. Touch ID prompt
3. ✅ Stored in keychain

Output:
```
GITHUB_TOKEN
NPM_TOKEN
HOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Delete secret:**

GITHUB_TOKEN=$(sec GITHUB_TOKEN)
NPM_TOKEN=$(sec NPM_TOKEN)

# Use in script
curl -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" ...
npm publish --token "$NPM_TOKEN"
```

**Unsafe pattern (avoid):**
```bash
# ❌ DON'T: Hard-code secrets
export GITHUB_TOKEN="ghp_hardcoded"  # NEVER DO THIS

# ✅ DO: Use keychain
export GITHUB_TOKEN=$(sec GITHUB_TOKEN)
```

#### Token Expiration

**Check token expiration:**
```bash
tok expiring
```

Output:
```
GitHub Token: 45 days remaining ✅
NPM Token: 5 days remaining ⚠️
```

#### Token Rotation

**Rotate token:**
```bash
tok rotate github
```

Workflow:
1. Touch ID (get current value)
2. Shows current value (for reference)
3. Prompts for new value
4. Touch ID (store new value)
5. ✅ Token rotated

**Complete rotation example:**
```bash
# 1. Check expiration
flow doctor --dot
# Output: GitHub Token: 5 days remaining ⚠️

# 2. Generate new token on GitHub
# (Settings → Developer Settings → Tokens)

# 3. Rotate
tok rotate github
# Current: ghp_old...
# Enter new: [paste new token]
# ✅ Rotated

# 4. Verify
flow doctor --dot=github
# Output: ✅ Valid (expires in 90 days)
```

**Refresh token:**
```bash
tok refresh github
```

---

### Advanced

#### Token Cache Management (v5.17.0)

**Check cache status:**
```bash
flow doctor --dot --verbose
```

Output:
```
GitHub Token
  Status: ✅ Valid

---

#### Exam Generation (Scholar Integration)

**Generate exam:**
```bash
teach exam "Midterm 1: Chapters 1-4"
```

Scholar workflow:
1. Analyzes course content (lectures, assignments)
2. Identifies key concepts
3. Generates questions at appropriate Bloom levels
4. Creates answer key
5. Outputs markdown file

Output:
```
✅ Generated: exams/midterm-1.md
   - 10 questions (3 Remember, 4 Apply, 3 Analyze)
   - Answer key included
   - Estimated time: 50 minutes
```

**With custom template:**
```bash
teach exam --template scholar/midterm "Midterm 1"
```

---

#### Quiz Generation

**Weekly quiz:**
```bash
teach quiz "Week 5: Regression Diagnostics"
```

Similar to exam but shorter, focused on single week.

---

#### Health Check (v6.5.0)

Two-mode environment validation for teaching projects.

**Quick check (default, < 1s):**
```bash
teach doctor
```

Checks 4 categories: dependencies, R environment + renv, project config, git setup.

**Full check (3-5s):**
```bash
teach doctor --full
```

Adds 7 categories: R packages, Quarto extensions, Scholar integration, git hooks, cache health, LaTeX macros (opt-in), teaching style.

**Output modes:**
```bash
teach doctor --brief      # Warnings/failures only
teach doctor --verbose    # Per-package R detail, full macro list
teach doctor --json       # Machine-readable JSON
teach doctor --ci         # No color, exit 1 on failure
```

**Auto-fix:**
```bash
teach doctor --fix        # Interactive fix (implies --full)
```

Prompts for each fixable issue: missing deps, R packages, git hooks, stale cache.

**Health indicator:** Writes `.flow/doctor-status.json` — shows green/yellow/red dot on `teach` startup.

!!! note "Macro checks are opt-in"
    LaTeX macro registry and unused macro checks only run when
    `scholar.latex_macros.enabled: true` in teach-config.yml.

## Aliases

Flow CLI uses a minimalist alias approach - high-frequency commands only.

### Quick Stats

- **Custom aliases:** 31 (R package + utility)
- **Git aliases:** 226+ (from git plugin)
- **Philosophy:** Memorize less, accomplish more

### Key Aliases by Category

| Category | Aliases | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **R Package** | `rload`, `rtest`, `rdoc`, `rcheck` | Development workflow |
| **R Quality** | `rcov`, `rcovrep` | Coverage reports |
| **R CRAN** | `rcheckfast`, `rcheckcran` | Submission checks |
| **Tool** | `cat='bat'` | Modern replacements |

### Dispatcher Shortcuts

Each dispatcher has built-in shortcuts:

```bash
g st          # git status
g co          # git checkout
r t           # r test
qu p          # qu preview
cc y          # cc yolo
```

### Quick Access

```bash
als           # List all aliases by category
```

## em Dispatcher

**Domain:** Email management via himalaya CLI
**File:** `lib/dispatchers/email-dispatcher.zsh` + `lib/em-himalaya.zsh`, `lib/em-ai.zsh`, `lib/em-cache.zsh`, `lib/em-render.zsh`
**Version:** v7.0.0+

### Overview

The `em` dispatcher wraps the himalaya CLI with ADHD-friendly email management: AI-powered drafting, smart content rendering, fzf browsing, and explicit send confirmation.

### Commands

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `em` | | Quick pulse (unread + 10 latest) |
| `em inbox [N]` | | List N recent emails (default: 25) |
| `em read <ID>` | `em r` | Read email with smart rendering |
| `em send` | `em s` | Compose new email in $EDITOR |
| `em reply <ID>` | `em re` | Reply with AI draft (--no-ai, --all, --batch) |
| `em find <query>` | `em f` | Search emails |
| `em pick [FOLDER]` | `em p` | fzf email browser with preview |
| `em respond` | `em resp` | Batch AI drafts for actionable emails |
| `em classify <ID>` | | AI category classification |
| `em summarize <ID>` | `em sum` | One-line AI summary |
| `em unread` | | Show unread count |
| `em dash` | | Quick dashboard |
| `em folders` | | List mail folders |
| `em html <ID>` | | Render HTML email in terminal |
| `em attach <ID>` | | Download attachments |
| `em cache stats\|prune\|clear\|warm` | | Manage AI cache |
| `em doctor` | | Check dependencies |
| `em help` | | Show help |

### Quick Start

```bash
em                      # Quick pulse check
em pick                 # Browse with fzf (Enter=read, Ctrl-S=summarize)
em reply 42             # AI-draft reply, opens in $EDITOR
em respond              # Batch process actionable emails
em doctor               # Check all dependencies
```

### Architecture

Six-layer stack: `em()` dispatcher → himalaya adapter → himalaya CLI, with AI abstraction, cache, and render pipeline layers.

### Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `FLOW_EMAIL_AI` | `claude` | AI backend (claude/gemini/none) |
| `FLOW_EMAIL_PAGE_SIZE` | `25` | Default inbox page size |
| `FLOW_EMAIL_FOLDER` | `INBOX` | Default folder |
| `FLOW_EMAIL_AI_TIMEOUT` | `30` | AI operation timeout (seconds) |

### Safety

- Every send requires explicit `[y/N]` confirmation (default: No). No auto-send.
- Listserv emails (`@LIST.*`) auto-skipped in `em respond`; warning shown if actionable.
- Discarded drafts tracked separately from sent replies (via `script(1)` detection).
- 9-category AI classification: student, colleague, admin-action, scheduling, urgent (actionable) + admin-info, newsletter, vendor, automated (auto-skip).
