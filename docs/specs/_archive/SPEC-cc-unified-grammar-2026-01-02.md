# SPEC: CC Unified Grammar

**Status:** Done ✅
**Created:** 2026-01-02
**Released:** v4.8.0
**Completed:** 2026-01-02
**Target Version:** v4.8.0

**Implementation:**
- PR #162: feat: CC unified grammar - both command orders work (v4.8.0)
- Release: https://github.com/Data-Wise/flow-cli/releases/tag/v4.8.0
- Docs: https://Data-Wise.github.io/flow-cli/

**Outcome:** Shipped same-day (0% → 100% → Released). Both mode-first (`cc opus pick`) and target-first (`cc pick opus`) patterns now work identically. Zero breaking changes. 30 comprehensive tests passing.

---

## Overview

Add support for **both mode-first and target-first** command orders in the `cc` dispatcher, enabling users to write commands that read naturally (`cc flow opus`) while maintaining the unified pattern (`cc opus flow`). This spec implements **Option 3: Unified Grammar** from the brainstorm.

**Goal:** Support flexible command ordering without breaking existing workflows, optimizing for zero friction and consistency with flow-cli patterns.

---

## Primary User Story

**As a flow-cli user,**
**I want** to write `cc` commands in the order that feels natural to me,
**So that** I can launch Claude Code without thinking about syntax rules.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ `cc opus pick` works (mode-first, current behavior)
2. ✅ `cc pick opus` works (target-first, new behavior)
3. ✅ Both produce identical results
4. ✅ Zero breaking changes to existing workflows
5. ✅ `cc` (no args) still launches HERE instantly

---

## Secondary User Stories

### Story 2: Explicit HERE

**As a user concerned about launching in wrong directory,**
**I want** explicit syntax for "launch HERE",
**So that** my intent is clear in scripts/history.

**Solution:** Add `.` and `here` as target aliases

```bash
cc .                  # Explicit HERE
cc here               # Readable HERE
cc opus .             # Opus mode HERE
```text

### Story 3: Reserved Keyword Handling

**As a user with a project named "opus",**
**I want** to access my project without conflict,
**So that** I can use `cc` with any project name.

**Solution:** Modes take precedence, use `pick` for projects

```bash
cc opus               # Mode (Opus HERE)
cc pick opus          # Project (jump to 'opus')
```text

---

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture

#### Current State (v4.7.1)

```bash
cc [mode] [target]
  mode   = (empty) | yolo | plan | opus | haiku
  target = (empty) | pick | <project> | wt <branch>
```text

**Parsing:** Mode-first only, positional

#### Proposed State (v4.8.0)

```bash
cc [mode|target] [target|mode]
  mode   = (empty) | yolo | y | plan | p | opus | o | haiku | h
  target = (empty) | . | here | pick | <project> | wt <branch>
```text

**Parsing:** Detect mode vs target, accept either order

### Parsing Algorithm

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start[cc arg1 arg2] --> CheckArgs{Args?}
    CheckArgs -->|0 args| LaunchHere[Launch HERE]
    CheckArgs -->|1+ args| ParseFirst[Parse arg1]

    ParseFirst --> IsMode{arg1 in modes?}
    IsMode -->|Yes| ModeFirst[mode=arg1, target=arg2 or HERE]
    IsMode -->|No| IsTarget{arg1 in targets?}

    IsTarget -->|Yes| TargetFirst[target=arg1, mode=arg2 or none]
    IsTarget -->|No| ProjectName[target=arg1 project, mode=arg2 or none]

    ModeFirst --> SetModeArgs[Set mode_args from mode]
    TargetFirst --> CheckMode2{arg2 in modes?}
    ProjectName --> CheckMode2

    CheckMode2 -->|Yes| SetModeArgs
    CheckMode2 -->|No| DefaultMode[mode_args=acceptEdits]

    SetModeArgs --> Execute[Execute: launch at target with mode]
    DefaultMode --> Execute

    LaunchHere --> End[Done]
    Execute --> End
```text

### Grammar Specification

#### Reserved Keywords (Modes)

```text
yolo, y       → --dangerously-skip-permissions
plan, p       → --permission-mode plan
opus, o       → --model opus --permission-mode acceptEdits
haiku, h      → --model haiku --permission-mode acceptEdits
```text

#### Reserved Keywords (Targets)

```text
(empty)       → HERE (current directory)
., here       → HERE (explicit)
pick          → Project picker (fzf)
wt, w         → Worktree (requires branch arg)
<string>      → Project name (via pick direct jump)
```text

#### Precedence Rules

1. If arg1 is mode keyword → parse as mode-first
2. If arg1 is target keyword → parse as target-first
3. If arg1 is unknown → assume project name (target)
4. Modes take precedence in conflicts

### API Design

#### Function Signature

```bash
cc [mode|target] [target|mode] [args...]
```diff

#### Examples Table

| Command | Mode | Target | Result |
|---------|------|--------|--------|
| `cc` | none | HERE | Launch HERE, acceptEdits |
| `cc opus` | opus | HERE | Launch HERE, Opus model |
| `cc pick` | none | pick | Picker → launch acceptEdits |
| `cc opus pick` | opus | pick | Picker → launch Opus |
| `cc pick opus` | opus | pick | Picker → launch Opus |
| `cc flow` | none | flow | Jump to flow → launch |
| `cc opus flow` | opus | flow | Jump to flow → launch Opus |
| `cc flow opus` | opus | flow | Jump to flow → launch Opus |
| `cc .` | none | HERE | Launch HERE (explicit) |
| `cc here opus` | opus | HERE | Launch HERE, Opus |

## UI/UX Specifications

### User Flow

```bash
User types: cc flow opus

   ↓
Detect: arg1='flow' (not a mode, assume target)
        arg2='opus' (is a mode)

   ↓
Parse: target='flow', mode='opus'

   ↓
Execute: pick --no-claude "flow" && claude --model opus --permission-mode acceptEdits

   ↓
Result: Changed to flow-cli directory, launched Claude with Opus
```text

### Help Text Updates

#### Before (v4.7.1)

```text
🚀 LAUNCH MODES:
  cc opus pick          Pick project → Opus model
```text

#### After (v4.8.0)

```text
🚀 LAUNCH MODES (Flexible Order):
  cc opus pick          Mode first (unified pattern)
  cc pick opus          Target first (natural reading)

  Both work! Use whichever feels natural.
```diff

### Accessibility

N/A - CLI only, no accessibility concerns

## Open Questions

### Q1: How to handle three-arg combinations?

**Example:** `cc yolo wt feature` (mode + target + target-arg)

**Options:**
- A. Parse left-to-right (current): mode=yolo, target=wt, arg=feature ✅
- B. Parse mode anywhere: detect yolo, parse rest as target
- C. Require mode-first for 3+ args

**Decision:** Option A (left-to-right, mode-first required for 3+ args)
**Rationale:** Simplest, consistent with current behavior

### Q2: Should we warn on ambiguous patterns?

**Example:** Project named "opus"

**Options:**
- A. Silent precedence (modes win, no warning)
- B. Warn once per session: "Did you mean cc pick opus?"
- C. Always warn
- D. Require explicit: `cc mode:opus` or `cc project:opus`

**Decision:** Option A (silent precedence)
**Rationale:** Matches user preference for zero friction

### Q3: Should `.` and `here` work with pick?

**Example:** `cc pick .` (pick project, then launch HERE?)

**Options:**
- A. Error: "pick and HERE are mutually exclusive"
- B. Ignore `.`: treat as `cc pick` ✅
- C. Special behavior: picker defaults to current dir

**Decision:** Option B (ignore `.`, treat as `cc pick`)
**Rationale:** `.` after pick is nonsensical, gracefully ignore

## Implementation Notes

### Phase 1: Core Parsing (Priority 1)

**File:** `lib/dispatchers/cc-dispatcher.zsh`

**Changes:**
1. Update `cc()` function to detect mode vs target
2. Add parsing logic for both orders
3. Add `.` and `here` as target keywords

**Estimated LOC:** ~50 lines (mostly case statements)

**Test coverage:**
- Unit tests for all combinations
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Edge case tests (ambiguity, conflicts)

### Phase 2: Documentation (Priority 2)

**Files to update:**
1. `docs/reference/CC-DISPATCHER-REFERENCE.md` - Add both-order examples
2. `CLAUDE.md` - Update quick reference
3. `README.md` - Update getting started
4. `_cc_help()` function - Update help text

### Phase 3: Completions (Priority 3)

**File:** `completions/_cc`

**Update completions to:**
- Suggest modes after targets: `cc flow <Tab>` → yolo, opus, haiku
- Suggest targets after modes: `cc opus <Tab>` → pick, flow, here

### Performance Considerations

**Current:** `cc` executes in <10ms (instant)

**After change:**
- Parsing adds ~2 case statements (negligible)
- No new external commands
- No caching needed

**Estimated:** <10ms (no measurable impact)

### Error Handling

**Invalid combinations:**

```bash
cc yolo plan          # Two modes
→ Error: "Cannot combine modes 'yolo' and 'plan'"

cc pick wt            # Two targets
→ Error: "Cannot combine targets 'pick' and 'wt'"

cc opus haiku         # Two modes
→ Error: "Cannot combine modes 'opus' and 'haiku'"
```text

**Unknown arguments:**

```bash
cc invalidmode
→ Assume project name, attempt pick direct jump
→ If pick fails: "Project 'invalidmode' not found"
```text

### Backward Compatibility

**v4.7.1 patterns (all still work):**

```bash
cc                    ✅ Launch HERE
cc pick               ✅ Picker
cc opus               ✅ Opus HERE
cc opus pick          ✅ Opus + picker
cc flow               ✅ Jump to flow
cc yolo wt feature    ✅ YOLO + worktree
```text

**New v4.8.0 patterns:**

```bash
cc pick opus          ✅ NEW: Opus + picker
cc flow opus          ✅ NEW: Jump to flow + Opus
cc here               ✅ NEW: Explicit HERE
cc .                  ✅ NEW: Explicit HERE (short)
```yaml
