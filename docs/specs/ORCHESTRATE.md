## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence for atomic commits:**

1. **Task 1** - Remove teach-init (clean slate)
2. **Task 2** - Basic doctor (foundation)
3. **Task 4** - Full doctor with --fix (complete health check)
4. **Task 3** - Add --help to all commands (UX improvement)
5. **Task 5** - Backup system (infrastructure)
6. **Task 6** - Prompt before delete (safety layer)
7. **Task 7** - Enhanced teach status (user visibility)
8. **Task 8** - Deploy preview (deployment safety)
9. **Task 9** - Scholar templates + lesson plan (power feature)
10. **Task 10** - teach init flags (optional enhancement)

Each task should be:

- Implemented completely
- Tested (unit + integration)
- Committed with conventional commit message
- Documented in code comments

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Each task MUST have corresponding unit tests
- Test both success and failure paths
- Test edge cases (missing files, invalid config, etc.)

### Integration Tests

- Test full workflows end-to-end
- Use scholar-demo-course as test fixture
- Validate all commands work together

### Validation Checklist

```bash
# Before each commit
./tests/test-teach-doctor.zsh           # If modifying doctor
./tests/test-teach-backup.zsh           # If modifying backups
./tests/test-teach-deploy.zsh          # If modifying deploy
./tests/run-all.sh                     # Full suite before PR

# Manual testing
cd ~/projects/teaching/scholar-demo-course
teach doctor                           # Should pass all checks
teach doctor --fix                     # Should offer installs
teach status                           # Should show new sections
teach deploy                           # Should show preview
```
