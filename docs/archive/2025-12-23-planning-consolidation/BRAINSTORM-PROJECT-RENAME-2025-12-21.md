# Project Rename Brainstorm - ZSH Workflow Manager

**Generated:** 2025-12-21
**Context:** ~/projects/dev-tools/flow-cli/
**Status:** Phase P5 Complete - Ready for Alpha Release

---

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

**What "flow-cli" Misses:**

- ❌ Sounds like dotfiles/config (generic)
- ❌ Doesn't convey ADHD optimization
- ❌ Doesn't hint at workflow management
- ❌ Too technical (scares non-developers)
- ❌ Doesn't differentiate from 1000+ zsh config repos

**What This Project Actually Is:**

- ✅ ADHD-optimized workflow manager
- ✅ Smart CLI dispatcher system
- ✅ Context-aware automation
- ✅ Cognitive load reducer
- ✅ Developer productivity multiplier
- ✅ Cross-project integration hub

**Key Differentiators:**

1. ADHD-first design (not an afterthought)
2. Smart dispatchers (pb/pv/pt auto-detect context)
3. Muscle memory over memorization
4. 84% alias reduction (179→28)
5. Comprehensive architecture docs
6. CLI + ZSH hybrid approach
