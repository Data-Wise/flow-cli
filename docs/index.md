> **ZSH workflow tools designed for ADHD brains.**
>
> Start working in 10 seconds. Stay motivated with visible wins.

!!! tldr "⚡ Get Started in 30 Seconds"
    ```bash
    brew tap data-wise/tap && brew install flow-cli
    work my-project         # Start session
    win "installed flow!"   # Log your first win
    ```
    **That's it!** No configuration required.

!!! success "🎉 What's New in v7.10.2"
    **Forward-looking schedule layer:** the **`agenda`** command surfaces dated activity across all projects — deadlines, lectures, exams, milestones, and recurring blocks — bucketed into OVERDUE / TODAY / THIS WEEK / LATER (`agt`/`agw`/`agm` aliases).
    **`dash` UPCOMING** + dated enrichment of `morning` / `today` / `week`, all driven by one shared engine. Works fully without `yq` and without atlas.
    **Data sources:** a no-`yq` `## Schedule:` section in each project's `.STATUS`, plus teaching dates from `.flow/teach-config.yml`.
    **New in v7.10.2:** a dedicated **Planning & Scheduling** documentation section, a rewritten Agenda tutorial with real command output and copy-paste recipes, clearer flow-cli ↔ Atlas framing, plus routine dependency maintenance. **64 suites** passing (216 files, 12000+ assertions).

## ⚡ See It in Action

The entire workflow in 3 commands:

```bash
work my-project    # Start session
win "Fixed bug"    # Log win → dopamine hit
finish             # Done
```

**Expected output:**

```text
$ work my-project
🚀 Starting session: my-project
   📍 ~/projects/my-project

$ win "Fixed the login bug"
🔧 fix: Fixed the login bug
   ✨ Win #1 today!

$ finish
✅ Session complete
   💾 Changes saved
```

!!! tip "Everything else is optional enhancement"
    These 3 commands are the core. Dispatchers (`cc`, `r`, `qu`, `teach`), dopamine tracking
    (`yay`, `flow goal`), and advanced features are bonuses.

## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

| ADHD Challenge           | flow-cli Solution            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| "Where was I?"           | `why` → shows context        |
| "What should I work on?" | `dash` → shows priorities    |
| No visible progress      | `win` → logs accomplishments |
| Context switching hurts  | `hop` → instant switch       |
| Starting is hard         | `work` → removes friction    |

## 🏆 Built-in Dopamine System

Every win gets categorized and tracked:

```bash
win "Fixed login bug"       # → 🔧 fix
win "Deployed to prod"      # → 🚀 ship
win "Added tests"           # → 🧪 test
```

**See your progress:**

```bash
yay              # Recent wins
yay --week       # Weekly graph
flow goal        # Daily progress (🌱🔥🔥🔥 streaks!)
```
