## 🎯 What Problem Does This Solve?

| ADHD Challenge           | flow-cli Solution            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| "Where was I?"           | `why` → shows context        |
| "What should I work on?" | `dash` → shows priorities    |
| No visible progress      | `win` → logs accomplishments |
| Context switching hurts  | `hop` → instant switch       |
| Starting is hard         | `work` → removes friction    |

---

## 🏆 Dopamine System

Every accomplishment gets logged with a category:

```bash
win "Fixed the login bug"      # → 🔧 fix
win "Deployed to production"   # → 🚀 ship
win "Added unit tests"         # → 🧪 test
win "Updated documentation"    # → 📝 docs
```

Then see your progress:

```bash
yay              # Recent wins
yay --week       # Weekly summary with graph
flow goal        # Daily progress bar
```

### 🔥 Streaks

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

!!! abstract "Built for ADHD"

    | Feature | Why It Matters |
    |---------|----------------|
    | **Sub-10ms response** | No waiting = no frustration. `pick` cached (40x faster!) |
    | **Smart defaults** | Works without configuration |
    | **Visible progress** | Dopamine from seeing wins |
    | **Consistent patterns** | Less to memorize |
