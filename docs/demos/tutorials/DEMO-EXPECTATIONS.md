## Demo 4: YAML-Driven Lesson Plans

### Command

```bash
teach lecture --lesson content/lesson-plans/week03.yml
```

### What You'll See

1. **Lesson Plan Loading**

   ```
   🎓 Scholar Enhancement - YAML-Driven Content Generation

   📋 Loading Lesson Plan: content/lesson-plans/week03.yml

   Week:      3
   Topic:     Introduction to Linear Regression
   Duration:  75 minutes
   Level:     Undergraduate
   ```

2. **Lesson Plan Structure**

   ```
   📚 Lesson Plan Structure:
      ✓ 4 learning objectives (understand → apply → analyze)
      ✓ 4 main topics with 12 subtopics
      ✓ 5 structured activities (lecture → code demo → discussion)
      ✓ Reading materials and datasets specified
      ✓ Teaching style overrides applied
   ```

3. **Content Generation Based on Plan**

   ```
   🎯 Content Generation Based on Plan:
      • Using OLS derivation activity (20 min, step-by-step)
      • Including R implementation demo (mtcars dataset)
      • Incorporating board work for theory section
      • Adding think-pair-share for practice
   ```

4. **Generated Lecture Outline**

   ```
   📝 Generating Lecture Outline:
      ✓ Opening: Review correlation, introduce regression (5 min)
      ✓ Theory: Model formulation, OLS derivation (25 min)
      ✓ Application: R demo with visualization (25 min)
      ✓ Practice: Coefficient interpretation (15 min)
      ✓ Closing: Summary & homework preview (5 min)
   ```

5. **Output Summary**

   ```
   ✅ Generated: lectures/week03-linear-regression.qmd (2,847 words)

      Sections:     5 (matches lecture structure)
      Code blocks:  8 (R examples with ggplot2)
      Derivations:  2 (OLS with intuition-first approach)
      Activities:   5 (fully specified with timing)
      Format:       Quarto with reveal.js support
   ```

**Expected Behavior:**

## Using the Demo Course

### Location

```bash
cd ~/projects/teaching/scholar-demo-course
```

### Structure

```

├── content/
│   └── lesson-plans/
│       └── week03.yml             # Linear regression lesson
├── lectures/                      # Generated lectures appear here
├── quizzes/                       # Generated quizzes appear here
└── slides/                        # Generated slides appear here
```

### Running Commands in Demo Course

```bash
# Navigate to course
cd ~/projects/teaching/scholar-demo-course

# Ensure flow-cli is loaded
source /Users/dt/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/feature/teaching-flags/flow.plugin.zsh

# Run any teach command
teach slides "Data Visualization" --style computational
teach lecture --lesson content/lesson-plans/week03.yml
teach quiz "Probability" --style conceptual --questions 10
```

### Course Configuration

The `teach-config.yml` provides:
- Course metadata (STAT 101, Spring 2026)
- Semester dates and weeks
- Scholar defaults (style, format, tone)
- Grading breakdown
- Topics list

When you run `teach` commands in this directory, Scholar uses this configuration automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Found: teach

**Problem:** `teach: command not found`

**Solution:**

```bash
# Load flow-cli first
cd /Users/dt/.git-worktrees/flow-cli/feature/teaching-flags
source flow.plugin.zsh
```

### Not a Teaching Project

**Problem:** "Not in a teaching project directory"

**Solution:**

```bash
# Navigate to teaching course first
cd ~/projects/teaching/scholar-demo-course

# Or run teach init in a directory
teach init "Course Name"
```

### Scholar Not Available

**Problem:** "Scholar commands require Claude Code CLI"

**Solution:**
The demos use simulated output, but real commands require:
1. Claude Code CLI installed
2. Scholar plugin loaded
3. Teaching project configured
